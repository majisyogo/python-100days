Clean and readable function-based code structure

ASCII art logo displayed at startup for better CLI experience

Beginner-friendly and easy to extend



How It Works

Run the program

The calculator displays a logo

The user inputs:

The first number

An operation (+, -, *, /)

The next number

The calculator displays the result

The user chooses:

y to continue calculating with the current result

n to start a new calculation


Example
What is the first number?: 10
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: +
What is the next number?: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

Type 'y' to continue calculating with 15.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: y
*
Pick an operation: *
What is the next number?: 2
15.0 * 2.0 = 30.0


The process repeats until the program is stopped
