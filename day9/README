## How It Works

1. Run the program
2. Each bidder inputs:
   - Their name
   - Their bid amount
3. After each bid, the program asks if there are more bidders
4. When bidding is finished:
   - The program compares all bids
   - Displays the winner and the highest bid

What is your name?: Alice
What is your bid?: $150
Are there any bidders? Type yes or no.
