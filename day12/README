Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple command-line number guessing game built with Python.
The player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, with a limited number of attempts based on the chosen difficulty level.


【Features】

Random number generation between 1 and 100

Two difficulty levels:

Easy (10 attempts)

Hard (5 attempts)

Clear feedback after each guess:

Too high

Too low

Correct answer

Remaining attempts displayed each round

Game over message when attempts run out

Beginner-friendly, function-based code structure

Demonstrates core Python concepts:

Functions

Loops

Conditionals

Return values

User input handling



【How It Works】

Run the program

A welcome message is displayed

The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100

The player chooses a difficulty level:

Type easy for 10 attempts

Type hard for 5 attempts

The game loop begins:

The player enters a guess

The program compares the guess with the correct answer

Feedback is shown:

"Too high."

"Too low."

Or a success message if correct

The number of remaining attempts decreases after each incorrect guess

The game ends when:

The player guesses the correct number, or

The player runs out of attempts

A final message is displayed indicating whether the player won or lost



【Learning Purpose】

This project is designed as a practice exercise for Python beginners to reinforce:

Function definition and usage

Passing arguments and returning values

Loop control with while

Basic game logic and state management

Avoiding global variables by using return values
